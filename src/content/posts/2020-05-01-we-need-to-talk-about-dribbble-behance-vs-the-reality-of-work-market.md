I have been postponing this article for a long time now, partially because many other respected and experienced designers have already talked about this, partially because impostor syndrome is a bitch and I've always had that tingly feeling that I'm not seasoned enough to even start talking about this. That is, until I've decided that I don't care, and that this is a important subject that should be debated more wildly regardless of experience and seniority.

I've been tackling with UI Design and Web Development since the end of 2018, but only took it in as a serious part of my learning cycles by half of 2019. Since then, I obviously searched for references on the web, and I've obviously crossed paths with Dribbble and Behance. It was around that time that I found about the existence of these pixel-perfect, almost state of art kind of designs that we generally see on these sites. And it was just as fast to learn why they did not represent any of the parameters we take in as we deal with the reality of this industry. Much of the difficulty of learning UI as a new skill-set had now ceased to be learning the craft itself, and became a task of filtering what was only aesthetically pleasing from that which sought to solve real life industry problems.

Don't get me wrong, I still believe that these platforms are good places to showcase work and seek inspiration (especially Behance, since it embraces a lot more variety on the kind of work that is showcased). But they need to be taken in with very carefully. There are many real problems that fictional projects from these platforms will not take in account. To list some of them:

- Client budget or scope limitations;
- Real user needs;
- Business rules that will likely impact interface flow;
- Technical limitations of the stack the product is going to be developed on;

The last one is the one where I can put my finger the most. Many of these designs will have interactive things that grow and jump and twist in a matter of seconds with unprecedented fluidity. And yet, they are all bullshit. Why?

> As the user looks at all of that jumping around and says: "oh f@#k!", the developer is also going to look at all of that and say: "OH F@#K!".

I think you get my point here, don't you?

# Pleasing the wrong audience

As we start to explore the root of this problem, it is important to make a key one very explicit:

> Designs like this are never made to please a potential user. They are made to please other designers.

This creates a network effect between designers with similar expertise, where everyone is patting everybody else in the back and saying "good job" to each other, which serves as way to inflate individual and collective ego. And I cannot start to tell you how bad this is; every design starts loosing identity and looking similar because they will always follow the same trend in search of relevance and visibility on these medias. If you've navigated through these websites before, you know exactly what I'm talking about here. Colorful gradients, ginormous amounts of parallax effects, and don't even let me start on the borderline ridiculous concept that is neomorphism design.

![Neumorphism](https://res.cloudinary.com/ernestoresende/image/upload/v1588353824/2020-05-01-we-need-to-talk-about-dribbble-behance-vs-the-reality-of-work-market/Neomorphism_l85eqz.png)

Adding on top of that, given the level of technical complexity these designs represent to a development team, most of them are never really built into fully functional webpages. And they probably never will be, forever remaining a proof of concept that heavily relies in aesthetically pleasing trends, but fails to accomplish real world deployment and usability.

Still don't believe me? That's completely understandable, and I respect that (people will listen to anyone in the internet these days, being critical and selective about what you consume is a good thing). So take a moment to visit the [web-design section](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design) on Dribbble, or better yet, Instagram accounts like [theuiuxcollective](https://www.instagram.com/theuiuxcollective/?hl=pt-br). Now try to find real websites built using those same design specs... You're not gonna find many.

# Figuring out functionality vs. aesthetics

Users will often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as a design that is more usable, because the beauty of it will make them more tolerant to usability issues. That doesn't mean that those issues cease to exist just by throwing layers of beautiful gradients, blurs and animations. For the contrary, they mask usability problems and prevents issues from being discovered during testing phases of the project. When this product is then published and released to a massive user-base, these issues will still be lingering there, and will probably cause a big headache in a near future. 

This so called "aesthetically-usability effect" was first studied in the field of human-computer interaction in the mid-90's by researchers Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura, who tested 26 variations of an ATM UI on 252 participants of the study. It was concluded that users are strongly influenced by the aesthetics of a given interface, even when they try to evaluate the underlying functionality of the system. You can read an in-depth article about the aesthetic-usability effect in [this article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/) from the Nielsen Norman Group.

# Finding designs that go beyond the surface

With everything that was exposed until now, we can confidently say that, given industry parameters, it can be really hard to find good designers in the real world. When we are about to join a team and create real products, our list of concerns needs to be changed. Someone who designs a beautiful UI, but it's not worried with accessibility is probably going to create problems to the future user. Someone who doesn't take into account the technical limitations of the project is gonna cause a massive setback to the development team... And so on.

Now, remember what I said in the beginning about how I felt refrained from writing this article because of my lack of seniority? That's exactly the point I wanted to tackle here. I wildly believe that tutoring someone about a subject is a massive responsibility not to be taken lightly, and experience about said subject counts massively towards that. But I also believe that are many key problems out there that need to be discussed at an entry level so newcomers don't spend time working their knowledge towards massively popular trends and modisms that don't reassemble reality.

The way I see it, new generations of UI designers that are about to come **need** to learn — and very soon — to differentiate these cases and work their knowledge gathering towards, well, the user experience as a whole, and not only to visual design independently.

It is important for your portfolio not only to show a competent visual quality, but also the thought process behind it. And by thought process I'm not talking about deciding between 30px or 60px in the padding. 

# Final Considerations

I want to leave this article by expressing what I believe to be best-case scenario to build a solid career as a UX/UI professional. Being part of the industry means thinking about how it works: understanding it's requirements and technical limitations, analyzing user profiles, knowing who is your user-base, and creating meaningful designs to solve problems in a given context using real-life scenarios. 

I know, it's way harder to think globally about the project or product you're designing and focusing on aspects that come before the visual design. Nonetheless, it is a much more rewarding experience to create a solution to a problem than just synthetic designs that are completely detached from the bonds of reality.
