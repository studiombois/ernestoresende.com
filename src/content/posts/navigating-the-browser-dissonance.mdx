We all hate browser inconsistency in its many levels. It's infuriating, drives us crazy in it's most complicated forms, and forces us to double on the work of cross-browser compatibility if we want to make sure users are being presented with consistent content in different browsers.

How exactly did we get to this? We could nail it down to essentially how different *browser engines* render content to the screen, but in reality, it is far more complicated than that.

<InformationSidenote title="Browser Engine?">  

  <p className='last-line'>We usually refer to the browser engine as a group of engines responsible for presenting the content of a webpage. It's composed of a rendering engine and a JavaScript engine, the first one being the most tightly coupled with the browser engine, as the JS engine can be worked upon even without the presence of a browser (Node.js is basically this).</p>

I want to discuss here the impacts that a broad browser diversity has on development cycles that take cross-browser support into account, and how trying to run away from it may lead us into a false paradise where everything tastes like Chromium.

# Relics of a lost past

In a quick glance over the timeline 2000s era of browsers, we could see something like this:

- 2002 - Following Netscape's downfall, Internet Explorer gained massive market share, and had its development internalized to Microsoft's ecosystem.
- 2003 - Apple starts shipping Safari as the default browser on macOS systems.
- 2004 - The now open-sourced Netscape was turned into Mozilla Firefox.
- 2008 - The first version of Chrome was launched, as Internet Explorer started losing traction to other browsers due to inferior quality and several anti-trust lawsuits.

The web industry of that time saw four main browser engines entangled on fierce competition, forcing companies to try to outpace their competitors, and even setting up the foundations for new web-standards to be born and submitted to W3C.

Chrome then comes in. Firefox and IE both lose a massive user-base, Chrome open-sources parts of it's core, and absurdly grows in user adoption.

Enter the scene we have nowadays; a plethora of Chrome-like browsers (Brave, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi) running the scene along with Chrome, with few competitors on the ring with them, namely Firefox and Safari. 

Why did a bring this up? Because it's important to understand the circumstances that have lead us to Google's monopoly over the majority of the web and how they have massive say about what practices becomes web-standard in the future.

In The Ecological Impact of Browser Diversity, Rachel Nambers points to the fact that having that massive userbase under your flag is a major competitive advantage:

"Chrome has the most resources and leads the pack in building the Web forward to the point that we can’t be sure if we’re building the Web we want… or the Web Google wants."

With a single browser engine being used by the majority of users we are developing for, it's easy to feel that we don't have the obligation to support other audiences, or end up hyper-focusing on the idea that we're "trying to build a better web" with the streamlining of web engine diversity, while further contributing to corporate monopoly.

# The swift winds of competition

If you think about it, IE6 was great when it first came out. The main reason its market share declined over the years was that they didn't care to keep building on top of it, focusing on other fronts instead. As a consequence, Firefox started taking over.

Competition in this context is not about crushing the competitor. It's about sparking innovation. The lack of competition creates stagnated markets where the king-of-the-hill is comfortable enough with not pushing the bar further. 

The cycle repeats itself, and Google monopolizes the web environment the same way IE did a decade ago.

# Browser diversity decadence

Opera and Edge went to Chromium. Many of the bold take-ups on browser finality (Vivaldi with its customization, Brave with privacy, and so on) are mere flavors of Chrome behind the shell.

As more and more users gravitate towards this ecosystem, development cycles are no longer obligated to make cross-browsing support a priority. Chrome enjoys the benefit of having the majority of the web development community building and testing for their platform. 

We could make the point that this is actually a good thing. Cross-compatibility issues are a major problem for developers, and the more we streamline the ecosystem we develop for, the better will be our development experience.

But in the other side of that coin, if we are truly moving to get a single browser engine powering the entirety of the web, are we really prepared to let Google have the ultimate say over what are the web-standards (more then what they already have with SEO and ads).
